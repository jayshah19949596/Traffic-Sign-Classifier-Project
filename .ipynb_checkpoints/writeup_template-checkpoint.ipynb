    "#### Pre-processing techniques used \n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "My preprocessing pipeling has following steps :\n",
    " 1. Gaussian blurring on the image\n",
    "   - I have used gassian blur to smoothen the image\n",
    "   - This reduces the noise from the images \n",
    "   - Used 5x5 gaussian filter on the image \n",
    "   - Used OpenCv for applying the gaussian filter\n",
    "   - cv2.GaussianBlur(img, (5,5), 20.0)\n",
    " 2. Crop the blurred images\n",
    "   - Remove boreder pixels from the images\n",
    "   - The border pixels are of no use in classification \n",
    "   - The boreder pixels are not part of the signs but the are the background in the images\n",
    "   - the border pixels will confuse out model\n",
    "   - So I decided to remove the border pixels\n",
    " 3. Change image Contrast\n",
    "   - Tried to make all the images a high contrast images \n",
    "   - This is done so that images are more clear\n",
    "   - The color of the images is more solid to see by the model\n",
    " 4. Equializing the histogrm of the image\n",
    "   - After making th eimage high contrast there wont be much intensity variation in the similar regions of the image\n",
    "   - To make a the image look more solid and clearer I applied histogram equalization \n",
    "   - This technique will improve the contrast of our images\n",
    "   - Used OpenCv to Equalize the histograms\n",
    "   - cv2.equalizeHist(img)\n",
    " 5. Normalization\n",
    "   - This is done so that all pixels are at a range from 0 to 1\n",
    "   - This helps so that the high density and low density pixels don't much affect our classification\n",
    "   - For example images of same class whether in brighter light or less light should not be classified as different classes\n",

    "- The data provided for training is not enough \n",
    "- Many classes of our training data has less number for training data.\n",
    "- It is possible that there is a chance of bias training as many classes has lot's of training data while many classes have less training data\n",
    "- Because of less data for few classes the model will give prediction of the data for the class it has seen the most\n",
    "- This is what I thought of and decided that there has to be data augmentation needed\n",
